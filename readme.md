# PART 2: GAME DESIGN

### MECHANICS / TECHNOLOGY
There is one central while-loop, the Game Loop, that displays the essential gameplay screen. Additionally, the Game Loop calls other functions within the file that run their own loops to display different in-game "screens". For example, the Game Loop will call a Main Menu function, Pause function, Game Pause function, etc. to show the player different displays without affecting the primary Game Loop. This allos gameplay to start and stop without impacting the players performance or score.

### STORY
The story of the game is that you're a fisherman trying to catch as many fish as possible. The gimmick is that you're fishing hundreds of millions of years in the past! The player begins at the start of the Paleozoic Era, beginning with the Cambrian Period, and progresses through the Era, ending with the Permian Period.

The protagonist is the fisherman. They just want to spend a relaxing day on the water and get a couple of fish in the boat. The only problem is something is wrong with spacetime... but that won't stop them from fishing the day away.

The antagonists are the great beasts that roamed the oceans in ancient history. They are big and mean and ready to ruin the fisherman's peaceful day.

### PLAYER EMOTIONS
I want the players to be fascinated and intrigued by the information they learn. It's not everyday that you're learning about the periods of the Paleozoic Era and their relative fauna.
Challenge-wise the game requires multi-tasking. The player must catch as many fish as possible while navigating moving obstacles.
The player will see real-time updates in their score and movements. Additionally, at the end of the game they will see any achievements they've gotten and their final score.
